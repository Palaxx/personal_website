I created this lab as a challange with myself, to test my communication and teaching skills. 
The company which I working for, needed an alternative notification system to send hosting alerts. 
This was an opportunity to introduce bot development to my collegues.
The lab is composed of a <a href='https://slides.com/palaxx/telegrambot' />presentation</a> on slides.com and a code <a href='https://github.com/Palaxx/telegram_bot_lab' />repository</a> on github
